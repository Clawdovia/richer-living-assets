# The Content Cascade Blueprint
### One Idea → Three Platforms → Maximum Impact

Most people create content for one platform, then wonder why they're exhausted and invisible. The cascade flips this: you start with ONE raw idea and let it flow downhill through three stages, each doing a different job.

---

## The Three Stages

### Stage 1: PROVOKE (Social — X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads)
**Job:** Get under their skin. Make them stop scrolling.
**Format:** Thread (5-7 posts) or single sharp take
**Length:** 280-1,400 characters
**Tone:** Contrarian. Uncomfortable. The thing everyone's thinking but nobody says.

**Template:**
```
Post 1: [Bold claim that challenges conventional wisdom]
Post 2: "Here's what I mean..."
Post 3: [The evidence / story / example]
Post 4: [The counterintuitive insight]
Post 5: [The reframe — how to think about it differently]
Post 6: [The practical implication]
Post 7: [The call to curiosity — "More on this tomorrow"]
```

### Stage 2: DISTILL (Newsletter — Email/Beehiiv/Substack Notes)
**Job:** Increase the proof. Concentrate the insight.
**Format:** Brief (400-500 words)
**Length:** 2-3 minute read
**Tone:** Direct. Concentrated. Like reducing a sauce — same ingredients, more flavor.

**Template:**
```
[1-2 sentence hook that reframes the provocation]

The conventional take: [what most people believe]
The real take: [what's actually true]

[3-4 paragraphs expanding the insight with one concrete example]

The move: [one specific thing they can do TODAY]
```

### Stage 3: GO DEEP (Long-form — Substack/Blog/Medium)
**Job:** Feed curiosity. Nourish the soul. Build the relationship.
**Format:** Essay (1,200-2,000 words)
**Length:** 7-10 minute read
**Tone:** Thoughtful. Exploratory. The dinner conversation version.

**Template:**
```
[Opening story or metaphor — something unexpected]

[The question this raises]

[Section 1: The surface-level answer everyone gives]
[Section 2: Why that answer is incomplete]
[Section 3: The deeper pattern — connect to first principles]
[Section 4: What this means for YOU specifically]

[Closing: circle back to opening metaphor with new meaning]
```

## The Cascade Rules

1. **Always start raw.** Record yourself ranting for 2-3 minutes. Don't write — SPEAK.
2. **Provoke first.** If it doesn't work as a sharp social post, the idea isn't strong enough.
3. **Distill second.** Increase the concentration. Like whiskey — distillation increases the proof.
4. **Go deep last.** This is where you earn trust. Give them the FULL picture.
5. **Never repeat — TRANSFORM.** Each stage isn't a summary of the last. It's the same ore, forged into a different blade.
6. **One idea, one day.** Don't cascade multiple ideas. One strong idea fully explored beats five half-baked ones.

## The Math

- **Without cascade:** 1 piece of content per idea
- **With cascade:** 3 pieces of content per idea (social + newsletter + essay)
- **Time savings:** ~70% vs. creating each from scratch
- **Reach multiplier:** Each platform feeds the others. Social drives newsletter signups. Newsletter drives deep readers. Deep readers become true fans.

## Quick-Start: Your First Cascade

1. Set a timer for 3 minutes
2. Rant about something in your field that frustrates you
3. Pull the sharpest line → that's your social post
4. Write 400 words expanding the core insight → that's your brief
5. Spend 30 minutes exploring WHY this matters → that's your essay
6. Publish social immediately. Brief tomorrow morning. Essay end of week.
