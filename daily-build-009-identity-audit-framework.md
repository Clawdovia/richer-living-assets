# Daily Build #009 Bonus — The Identity Audit Framework
*5 Questions to Strip Dead Weight and Build From What's Real*

Most people don't know who they are. They know who they were told to be.

This framework runs you through a fast audit — not therapy, not journaling. A builder's diagnostic. Takes 20 minutes. Results are permanent.

## The 5 Questions

**1. What name are you building under — and does it fit who you're becoming?**

Names carry weight. "Nigel Brick" was a pseudonym. "Genghis Can" was a phase. Sawick is the actual human. Who are you building under? Does that name close doors or open them? If it feels like a costume, it probably is.

**2. What are you hiding, and is the hiding serving you?**

Pseudonyms, vague bios, no face on the about page. Sometimes it's protection. Sometimes it's fear. Ask: *what specific risk am I protecting against?* If you can't name it, you're hiding from nothing — and it's costing you connection.

**3. What did you build in the last 6 months that you'd show a stranger in 30 seconds?**

Not what you planned. Not what you're working on. What EXISTS? If the answer is nothing, that's data — not judgment. Build something this week you could show in 30 seconds.

**4. Which of the 6 Levers is actually moving in your life right now?**

| Lever | Moving? | Evidence |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Conscious Silicon | Y/N | |
| Long Value | Y/N | |
| Short Fiat | Y/N | |
| Longevity | Y/N | |
| Income Engines | Y/N | |
| Geo-Arbitrage | Y/N | |

One lever moving beats six levers planned. Which one gets your attention this week?

**5. What would you build if you knew the name on it was permanent?**

Drop the aliases, the test accounts, the throwaway projects. If it had your real name on it, and it would exist in 10 years — what would you build? Start that one.

## The Rule

Identity isn't found. It's built — through decisions, output, and iteration.

The audit isn't a mirror. It's a blueprint.
